About CAPSTONE PROJECT  CRIMES IN INDIA

 In todayâ€™s world crimes are on the rise, misuse of technology and various socio economic factors have led to global increase of crimes.In the  world,Women and children in India face atrocities like rape, kidnapping, and abduction, dowry deaths, assault, insult to the modesty of Women, cruelty by husband or his relatives, importation of girls etc..
 
 In this project, I will attempt to discover the factual data on the states with the highest crime rate against women, year over year increase in the crimes, count of each crime within the country classified on the basis of individual states as well.
Here I use Pandas which provides several methods for reading data in different formats.
Matplotlib and seaborn - used for plotting basic and advanced visualizations respectively.
This project have 4 phases.

1.Data collection

2.State/UT wise analysis.

3.sql operations

4.Unsupervised learning



As a part of this poject in PHASE 1 ,I used to collect information from wikkipedia for population,literacy rate and Area 

of each state.Then I will merge the other information fom the given datasets for  further analysis .also used many 

graphs to analysis the crime rate literacy rate and all for making furher predictionS in PHASE 2.SO I can understand the 

factors influencing the crime rate Then I moved to Phase 3 for sql operations insert,min,max functions to find All the lowest 

number of rapes & Kidnappings that happened in which state, District, and year. At last but not the least, Phase 4. which is 

cluster based. Use DBSCAN,Hierachial clustering for finding the sensitive,moderate and peaceful area.


To conclude, crime against women in India is high and it's the need of the hour to take appropriate measures against 

the culprits to make this nation a safe haven for women.

Suggestion to reduce women crime in India:
With poverty, unemployment isolation some people get into orpushed into the world of crime but literacy training can provide many youths and adults a chance to build a brighter future.
